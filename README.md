11th place solution for Kaggle Human Protein Atlas Image Classification

## General
This repository which contains our team's solution for [Human Protein Atlas Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification). And my teammates include [qrfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/action), [shisu](https://www.kaggle.com/shisususu), [lihaowei](https://www.kaggle.com/lihaoweicvch), [chenjoya](https://www.kaggle.com/chenjoya), [hadxu](https://www.kaggle.com/hadxu123) and [chizhu](https://www.kaggle.com/chizhu2018). I am very grateful for their selfless effortsï¼Œ

## Team Details
[qrfaction](https://github.com/qrfaction) used the Nadam optimizer and explored effective data augmentation, [lihaowei](https://www.kaggle.com/lihaoweicvch) was responsible for solving the problem of data distribution, [shisu](https://www.kaggle.com/shisususu) was the main author of our third stage experiment, and I was responsible for tuning parameters and trained different large model because I had 4xp40. <br>
**We've done a lot of experiments with different optimizers, different learning rate decay, different data augmentation, different data distribution, different model and so on.** Every teammate did a great job.<br>
[Tha main author of code for first and second stage experiments](https://github.com/Gary-Deeplearning/Human_Protein/tree/master/stage1%262) was [qrfaction](https://github.com/qrfaction)<br>
[And the main author of code for third stage experiments](https://github.com/Gary-Deeplearning/Human_Protein/tree/master/shisu_code) was [shisu](https://www.kaggle.com/shisususu)
